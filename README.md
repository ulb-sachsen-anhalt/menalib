# OCR project GT4ara
The Specialized Information Service for Middle East, North African and Islamic Studies is committed to improving OCR for Arabic.
We are working with [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and the [tesstrain](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesstrain) module. As part of this effort, our training data for Arabic as well as our GroundTruth guidelines can be found within this repository. Feel free to contact us regarding any questions or improvement suggestions.
